# CLI module

Module to download CLIs into local bin directory. This module is primarily intended to be used as a submodule within other modules. The CLIs currently supported are:

- jq
- yq v3
- yq v4
- igc
- kubeseal
- gh cli
- glab cli
- rosa cli
- ibmcloud cli
- ibmcloud infrastructure plugin
- ibmcloud observe plugin

The module outputs the bin directory for use by other modules.

**Note:** This module uses an external data source to setup the clis. External data sources have a limitation in terms of real-time feedback of progress. To increase the visibility of what the module is doing, the data source writes logs to `clis-debug.log` in the current working directory.
